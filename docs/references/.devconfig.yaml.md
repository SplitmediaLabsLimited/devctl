# .devconfig.yaml

This file should be in the root of each services in the project, and it defines the configuration for each service. Most of the time, it's for generating docker-compose files, but it can also be used to generate `.env` files. The contents of this file is optional -- it only needs to exists for it work.

```yaml
# This is the key that builds the docker-compose
# This whole thing is optional. This file just needs to exists, it can be empty if you do not need to create containers or set .env files
compose:
  # this is a special key that will be used as a base for all environment
  default:
    # this is the docker-compose data. Also include the name of the services... because some services requires multiple containers. For example: PHP and Nginx
    # make sure that the service names don't collide with any other services name in the same project. For example, if you have 2 PHP services, one should be called `php-frontend` and the other `php-api` for example.
    nginx-api:
      image: nginx:latest
      links: [php-api]
      environment:
        hello: world
    php-api:
      image: php:latest
      environment:
        hello: world2

  # You can add more environments here
  dev:
    nginx-api:
      image: nginx:latest
      links: [php-api]
      environment:
        hello: dude
    php-api:
      image: php:latest
      environment:
        hello: dudette

# This builds the .env files when its selected
dotenv:
  # this is the default. It gets merged thru all environment as lower priority
  default:
    DEBUG: '*'
  dev:
    DEBUG: 'api*'
```

## Advanced

This file can also be a javascript file that returns functions! Just name it `.devconfig.js` instead. The above file can be written like this in javascript:

```js
module.exports = {
  compose: function(current, project) {
    console.log('compose', current, project);

    return {
      'nginx-api': {
        image: 'nginx:latest',
        links: ['php-api'],
        environment: {
          hello: 'dudee',
        },
      },
      'php-api': {
        image: 'php:latest',
        environment: {
          hello: 'dudette',
        },
      },
    };
  },
  dotenv: function(curreent, project) {
    console.log('dotenv', current, project);

    return {
      DEBUG: 'api*',
    };
  },
};
```
